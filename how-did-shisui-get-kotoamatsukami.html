Later, Shisui entrusted his remaining eye to Itachi Uchiha, who implanted it into the eye-socket of one of his crows.</span></span></span></span><h2>How did Shisui use Kotoamatsukami?</h2>What is Shisui's Kotoamatsukami? Shisui's kotoamatsukami is a genjustu where he injects an idea into the opponent making it seem like its his idea, thus its hard to know if you are ever caught in his genjutsu. its been called the ultimate genjutsu by itachi himself.<h2>Why did Shisui not use Kotoamatsukami on Danzō?</h2>The whole reason Danzo chose to steal the sharingan from shisui was to keep them from using it on the uchiha, Danzo felt that use of kotoamatsukami to keep the uchiha from revolting would only delay the coup, he wanted the uchiha gone permanently to remove the possibility.<h2>Does Shisui have to wait 10 years to use Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Yes, it does take Shisui ten years to recharge.<h2>Can Shisui use Kotoamatsukami anytime?</h2>In essence, yes. As long as Kotoamatsukami is available when he enters the fight.<h2>Explaining Kotoamatsukami</h2><p></p><h2>Is Tsukuyomi stronger than Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Kotoamatsukami is the perfect jutsu for manipulation, assassination, or political takeovers. In terms of battle usage, Tsukuyomi takes the edge. However, Kotoamatsukami comes out on top in sheer jutsu power.<h2>Can Kotoamatsukami be broken?</h2>Because it clearly overwrites the persons brain you cannot break free of this jutsu. Nobody flooding you with chakra or telling you otherwise will work. This means all people including perfect Jinchurikki such as Naruto and Killer bee are susceptible to this jutsu.<h2>Why didnt Danzō use Kotoamatsukami on Sasuke?</h2>Danzo was thinking of using kotoamatsukami on Sasuke or save it to out Tobi in a genjutsu but later he used it for the isanagi as he was out of chakra. And as Sasuke didn't give him another choice. Primarily because he didn't deem Sasuke too big of a threat. Danzo wanted power which is why he used it on Mifune.<h2>Did Danzō ever use Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Danzo knew about the power of Shisui's sharingan, but was also aware about its awakening period, i.e Danzo could not always use Shisui's sharingan due to the immense power of the jutsu (Kotoamatsukami) that Danzo was using.<h2>Does Kotoamatsukami need eye contact?</h2>Trivia. Unlike most Sharingan-based genjutsu, Kotoamatsukami does not seem to require eye contact, as demonstrated by how Danzō cast it on Mifune without apparently removing the bandages that covered his right eye.<h2>Why didn't Itachi get EMS?</h2>Itachi didn't get the eternal mangekyou because he just didn't want to. He did not want to take his father's/anyone else's eyes, because maybe he felt very guilty.<h2>Why didn't Shisui tell hiruzen about Danzo?</h2>Hiruzen would have believed itachi, as hiruzen knows how shady danzo is and as soon as all the Uchiha's were massacred, hiruzen quickly deduced that Danzō was responsible. Itachi didn't tell hiruzen because there was no point, itachi would still have to murder his clan.<h2>Can Shisui beat Minato?</h2>4 CAN BEAT: MINATO NAMIKAZE<p>Minato was capable of taking down entire armies on his own, and he was more than capable of beating Shisui.</p><h2>Who is the God of genjutsu?</h2>Sorry to burst your bubble, the God of Genjutsu is Uchiha Shisui. He's way better than Itachi in Genjutsu.<h2>Does Kotoamatsukami work on rinnegan?</h2>No it will not work on Rinnegan users, SPSM users with Yin-Yang release, users with stronger Yang release, or users stronger Yin release.. As strong as Kotoamatsukami is, it's still a Yin release…a very strong Yin release for that matter…<h2>What is the weakness of Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Kotoamatsukami's weakness is it's ten-year cooldown period. And while Senju Hashirama's regenerative powers reduce the cooldown to twenty-four hours (as opposed to eighty-seven thousand hours, Jesus Christ Kishimoto, what were you thinking?), only being able to use a jutsu once a day is still a pretty big weakness.<h2>How many times can Danzo use Izanagi?</h2>Danzō Shimura receives both Uchiha and Senju implants, allowing him to use Izanagi for one minute. As this is still not very long, he has ten Sharingan implanted in his right arm, giving him up to ten minutes' worth of Izanagi with breaks in between as he chooses.<h2>What is the strongest genjutsu?</h2>1 Infinite Tsukuyomi Is The Ultimate Genjutsu<p>The ultimate genjutsu—trapping the entire world is an illusion, forcing them to live out a dream whilst their chakra is taken. To carry out the genjutsu, one must possess the rinne sharingan and reflect it on the moon.</p><h2>Did Danzo use Izanagi no Shisui?</h2>In episode 358, Danzo uses Izanagi against Shisui and steals one of his eyes, meaning Danzo had a Sharingan eye prior to having Shisui's Sharingan eye.<h2>Could danzo use Kotoamatsukami on obito?</h2>He basically wanted to use the Kotoamatsukami against Tobi, because he was the main guy to be controlled. Show activity on this post. Realistically speaking, Danzo still has to wait until he uses Kotoamatsukami again. But hypothetically, this wouldn't have much of a benefit.<h2>Why did danzo not awaken the rinnegan?</h2>Danzo was not able to awaken the rinnegan because he had senju DNA and Uchiha eyes but had neither enough chakra to effectively utilize either ability (hashirama' s wood style or the sharingan in his arms).<h2>How strong is Kotoamatsukami?</h2>Kotoamatsukami is quite powerful and it allows the user to control other people without them even realizing. A power as dangerous as that is certainly above Itachi's Mangekyo Sharingan Genjutsu, Tsukuyomi.<h2>Who is immune to genjutsu?</h2>1.1 Does Genjutsu Work On The Rinnegan? deal with the elephant in the room first, namely the Rinnegan's supposed immunity to genjutsu. Ever since Sasuke was able to resist Infinite Tsukuyomi, there has been speculation that the Rinnegan is immune to all genjutsu.<h2>Why doesn't genjutsu work on jinchuuriki?</h2>If the Jinchuuriki and their tailed beast work together they can basically break every genjutsu put upon them since one of the counters against genjutus is to have the victim's chakra flow disrupted. This makes them mostly immune to them.<h2>Is the byakugan immune to genjutsu?</h2>But unlike the Sharingan, the Byakugan does not seem to give its users any particular defence against an opponent's genjutsu; in Book of Dark Night, genjutsu is deemed a viable method of capturing Mukai Kohinata, even with his Byakugan.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8eormacmZl6tLTIrKyiZZeawW63zq2mmqWRqcC2t8CmoA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-cancel-a-preorder-on-itunes.html>&#171;&nbsp;How to cancel a preorder on itunes</a>
