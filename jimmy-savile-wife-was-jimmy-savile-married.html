Sir James Wilson Vincent Savile OBE KCSG, a prominent English DJ, television, and radio personality, served as the host of several renowned BBC programs, notably “Top of the Pops” and “Jim’ll Fix It.” Throughout his lifetime, he gained widespread recognition in the United Kingdom for his distinctive persona and his extensive philanthropic endeavors.</p><p>A lot of people have been inquiring lot about Jimmy Savile wife and making various research about her on the internet.</p><p>This article talks about Jimmy Savile wife and everything there is to know about her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Biography of Jimmy Savile</h2><p>Jimmy Savile was an English DJ, television and radio personality who became a household name in the United Kingdom. Born on October 31, 1926, in Leeds, West Riding of Yorkshire, Savile’s career in the entertainment industry spanned several decades. He gained fame for hosting popular BBC shows such as Top of the Pops and Jim’ll Fix It. However, his life and legacy are marred by numerous allegations of sexual abuse that surfaced after his death.</p><p>During his teenage years, Savile worked in coal mines as a Bevin Boy and suffered spinal injuries. He began his career managing and playing records in dance halls. In his twenties, he even pursued a career as a professional wrestler, achieving considerable success.</p><p>Savile’s media career took off in 1958 when he became a DJ at Radio Luxembourg. He later joined Tyne Tees Television in 1960. He quickly gained a reputation for his eccentric and flamboyant personality. A significant part of his career involved working with children and young people, including hosting Jim’ll Fix It, a popular television program where he made the wishes of viewers, especially children, come true.</p><p>Aside from his professional endeavors, Savile was also known for his extensive charitable work. He supported and raised funds for various charities and hospitals, including Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Leeds General Infirmary, and Broadmoor Hospital. In fact, he was recognized as a prodigious philanthropist and received honors for his charity work, including an OBE in 1971 and a knighthood in 1990.</p><p>Sadly, after Savile’s death in October 2011, hundreds of allegations of sexual abuse against him were investigated. The police concluded that he had been a predatory sex offender, possibly one of Britain’s most prolific. The scandal surrounding his abuse led to inquiries and investigations at various institutions, including the BBC, the National Health Service, and the Crown Prosecution Service. Savile’s achievements and honors were posthumously revoked, and his shows, such as Top of the Pops, are no longer repeated.</p><p>It is important to note that the allegations against Savile emerged after his death, and during his lifetime, some accusers were dismissed or ignored. Savile even took legal action against a few accusers. The revelation of the extent of his abuse shocked the public and raised questions about the actions and inactions of the institutions that were aware of his behavior.</p><p>Despite his charitable work and initial positive reception, Jimmy Savile’s legacy is now tainted by the heinous crimes he committed. The revelations served as a wake-up call regarding the mistreatment and abuse of vulnerable individuals and sparked widespread discussions about the importance of believing and supporting victims of abuse.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jimmy Savile Wife: Was Jimmy Savile married?</h2><p>Was Jimmy Savile married?
