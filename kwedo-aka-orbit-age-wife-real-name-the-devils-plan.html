Soon after the episodes were out, viewers were quick to tweet their opinions about Kwedo. “Orbit is actually so smart and good in his second main game like he can forsee their rival team’s next move or plans during the game…” one of these fanatics gushed. Another new fan girl of Kwedo wrote “Watching the devil’s plan … I need orbit so badly”.</p><p>Kwedo must be not surprised because he gave it all after he was confirmed to be on the project. When he first got the call he said he was interested in science but not in other aspects of the show like competition and survival.

He had to talk about science for 16 hours a day, excluding sleeping and playing games. He also cried a lot because of the special family-like bond he formed with all eleven of them on the show. There, he said, made memories that he could not experience anywhere else. Also, he also requested watchers to understand that as part of the game, he made a fool of himself many a time by being excited, betraying his good friends, and crying a lot in an ugly way.</p><p>In addition to Kwedo, celebrities, lawyers, doctors, professional Go players, and more, were invited to the game to compete to win the ultimate prize of 500 million won (approximately $392,700).
