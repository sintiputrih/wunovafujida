the San Francisco Bay Area city of Pittsburg, California that often performs with a Hannibal Lecter style mask. He specializes in horrorcore music.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span><span id=Career>Career</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Delgado began his rap career in 1997 with childhood friend J RZ who formed Mad Insanity Records to release their basement style tapes to a circle of friends locally. His stage name “Mars” was a nickname he had been called by classmates as a short version of his name Mario.</p><p>In 1998 he released his first unofficial project S.I.D.S. on homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. Topics included rape, suicide, murder, and abortion. The tape is now considered a collectors item by fans.</p><p>On Sunday May 9, 1999 J RZ and Mars along with several members of the Mad Insanity Records roster and crew were involved in a fight with Detroit rapper Eminem and Proof at The Fillmore in San Francisco during Eminem’s performance on his first headlining “Slim Shady” tour. The incident was published in several notable hip-hop blogs as well as Bay Area newspapers allowing Mad Insanity Records to gain a regional buzz.</p><p>In 2001 Mars signed with Black Market Records and helped found Rest In Peace Records with Rod and Anthony Singleton. That same years Mars helped sign horrorcore pioneer Ganxsta NIP and released the Houston, Texas artist’s album <i>The Return Of The Psychopath</i> in stores nationwide and headed the publicity and marketing as project manager for the album. When Black Market CEO Cedric Singleton observed the success Mars achieved with the project management of Ganxsta NIP, he was assigned to oversee the latest album from convicted cannibal rap artist Big Lurch entitled “All Bad”. The Rest In Peace moniker was short lived due in part for Mars requesting his release from the label to push his own brand Mad Insanity Records.</p><p>2005 Mars released his debut album <i>Mars Attacks</i> with online stores selling out of copies its first day, two weeks before his release date on pre-orders alone. Later that year, he received national attention when fan Jeff Weise frequented Mars’ website and forum before killing nine people. Mars has stated on his website there was no link to Jeff whatsoever other than the suspect being a rabid fan of his music. Due to media attention and high buzz he gained the attention of hip-hop distribution label Beyond Spaced Entertainment and re-released “Mars Attacks” to stores both national and internationally.</p><p>That same year Mars was used as the model of a character in a movie based on a novel by Robert Crais. <i>Hostage</i> was adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson with the Mars influenced role played by Ben Foster.</p><p>On the August 19, 2008 Psychopathic Records and sub-label Hatchet House released their “Tunnel Runners” compilation featuring material from underground rappers and groups not signed to their roster. The compilation went on to hit the Top 25 rap albums on Billboard its first week. After the Mars track “They Watchin Me” featuring Mike Marshall became widely known as the most popular on the project, Violent J of the group Insane Clown Posse invited Mars to perform on Psychopathic Records “Shock Therapy Tour” alongside Anybody Killa, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Boondox, Axe Murder Boyz & J Reno. After Boondox experienced medical issues from a prior surgery, Mars replaced the artist on Insane Clown Posse’s 2008 Hallowicked Clown Tour.</p><p>In 2009 soon after the release of his album <i>School House Glock: Extra credit</i>, a project that blatantly poked fun at his previous controversy, Mars received international attention once again when it was learned that Mars’ music was an influence on the music of horrorcore fan Richard Sam McCroskey, who allegedly killed four people. McCroskey’s MySpace page listed Mars as his favorite rapper, and Mars told law enforcement he had seen and signed autographs for McCroskey at various events before the murders. From these events, he has been interviewed by several TV news outlets around the United States including CBS News, Fox News, ABC News, and CNN.</p><p>Mars releases his music on Mad Insanity Records, including his most recent The Zodiac Mixtape Limited Edition (LP) on March 20, 2012. On June 17, 2014 his entire discography was released on digital outlets through Empire Distribution including new singles <i>Hold On</i>, <i>Hurt Em</i>, and <i>Overnight Change</i>. After almost a year away from the music business he is set to release his “Creatures Of The Night” single featuring Twiztid and Tech N9ne sometime in 2016.</p><p>In October 2015 Mars was asked to interview his favorite horror figures for a take over of CBS Radio’s website Man Cave Daily. After landing interviews and photoshoots alongside actress Mena Suvari, Insane Clown Posse, and Sid Haig, he was asked to work full-time as a celebrity blogger and accepted a position with the show.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mars was born in Antioch, California, and raised throughout East Contra Costa County primarily in the city of Pittsburg. He attended Liberty High School, as well as Pittsburg Adult Education before dropping out of his regular curriculum and enrolling in various college courses including photography, marketing & communication, and publication design. He has two daughters, Valentina Delgado (born in 1999) and Angel Slatten (born in 2003) along with one son Gavin Mario Delgado (born in 2007) who has appeared in promotional videos, press, and music videos alongside his father including the Kung Fu Vampire music video for “Love Bites”. . In 2007 he was linked to adult film star Dawn Avril. In 2010 he started dating [[bikini barista]] and social media star Jessica Larson. In 2015 he dated erotic print model Melody Rain who he managed before their split a year later.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=discography></span><span id=Discography>Discography</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Studio albums<ul><li><i>S.I.D.S.
