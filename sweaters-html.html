Especially on old-school film, you can really appreciate the weight of a good jumper and the intricacy of a thick knit. Maybe it’s just that clothes were higher quality back then, or because Hollywood wardrobe budgets are bigger than our own. Either way, a good knit sets a mood, whether in a classic rom-com, a period piece, a prestige drama about fishermen, or a depressed Irish village. And unlike some more glamorous, out-there costumes, there’s something accessibly aspirational about a good sweater. Won’t you pull up a chair, pull on a pullover, and discuss some of our favorites with us?</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmthjb0e00573b7hegwxc91e@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Julie Christie’s white turtleneck in Doctor Zhivago</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e0a/df9/ec379042226f003209a8fbe6305668387f-doctor-zhivago-mgm.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmthjaye004r3b7h845wmtnz@published data-word-count=143>As one of the all-time winter movies, Doctor Zhivago offers plenty of opportunities for its characters to layer up in fur hats, long coats, and, of course, knitwear. Of all the sweaters worn throughout this movie — Phyllis Dalton won an Oscar for the costume design — it’s the one Julie Christie wears toward the end, when Lara and Yuri are holed up in the Urals in a dramatically iced-over summer house, that’s always stuck with me the most. Christie wears a cream-colored turtleneck that’s more 1960s than 1920s, but why quibble over something that looks this damn good? She sinks into the sumptuous, oversize collar as though the sweater were shielding Lara not just from the Russian chill but from imminent tragedy. There’s no more enviable item to wear when whiling away the last days of a grandly doomed romance. —Alison Willmore</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmthjb2x00593b7hswrl317n@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Claire Danes’s poof-shouldered sweater from The Essex Serpent&nbsp;</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c9c/eb0/cd4c8c04500f7aa8f3c8606c5c3dff5964-essex-serpent.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmthjayj004s3b7hf1txasz8@published data-word-count=200>There are many flavors of fine-but-non-notable TV. There’s “comforting procedural rhythms but otherwise unmemorable.” There’s “I reliably smiled, but I never once laughed.” There’s a very healthy genre of “gowns, beautiful gowns.” The Essex Serpent is a prime example from a cousin category to beautiful gowns: “Okay, but the knitwear!” This gorgeously produced Apple TV+ series stars Claire Danes and Tom Hiddleston, is based on a relatively successful book, is mysterious and maybe supernatural, and involves a slow-burn romance. As a whole, it’s also so dawdling, circular, and unmotivated that it’s a bit like watching endless stretches of misty moors and trying to get your eyes to focus on any single piece of landscape. But what it does have going for it is Danes’s entire wardrobe, and especially this sweater. Its shoulders appear to float above her arms like low-slung storm clouds. Their loftiness is grounded by a few rows of horizontal stripes, which connect them and also define the natural waistline. And then, this row of fussily spaced pom-poms stitched along the shoulder line … It’s The Essex Serpent distilled into a single object of clothing: so beautifully made, so much personality, but also, so, so gray. —Kathryn VanArendonk</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmthjb7k005c3b7h844t7q3x@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Cher’s long, fuzzy blue cardigan in Moonstruck</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmthjayj004t3b7h3ku0gvwg@published data-word-count=182>The sweater is the consummate “everyday” item —&nbsp;something you can throw on that instantly makes it seem like you have a full outfit. Pairing that with Cher gives her an immense power. The idea of an everyday item is innately contradictory to how we know Cher: Offscreen, she’s a pop goddess bedecked in Bob Mackie, and onscreen in&nbsp;<a href=#>Moonstruck</a>, the image of her and Nicolas Cage at their most glamorous while attending the opera comes just the night before. Then it’s breakfast, when <a href=#>Cher as Loretta Castorini</a>, away from the opera, must deal with the real world again, with all its familial drama, returning fiancés, and dying mothers. She does it in a fuzzy, oversize blue cardigan that somehow preserves Cher’s glamor while returning her to Earth. It’s a beautiful piece. She is both swathed in it and the center of attention. Her cuffed sleeves make it perfectly lived in. With a sexy updo and glamorous dangling earrings framing her face, she still pulls focus,&nbsp;but now she’s real enough to hit the emotional climax of the movie. A perfect outfit. —Jason P.

These knit fits also let us know that these are the popular girls — not the mean kind, but queens of the school nonetheless, because of how they’re able to pull off things like dorky argyle with their youth, beauty, and very intentional and timeless layering. Layers also suggest layers, and as Twin Peaks makes you sit with the freeze-frame of them, you realize that knit cardigans on sweaters on skirts on stockings also serve to cover things up and not let you in on the full extent of what’s going on underneath. Because “wholesomeness” is a paint job, and sweaters might protect you from the elements, but a fat lot of good they’ll do protecting you from evil men. Anyway, throughout the series, Donna’s knits continue to hit, striking a perfect middle ground between Audrey’s retro cropped sweaters and Lucy’s loud chunky ones. —Rebecca Alter</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmtvydcs001i3b7mu13nxpp9@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kurt Cobain’s thrifted cardigan on Unplugged</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmtvyd9v001h3b7muxm37c3y@published data-word-count=183>A thrifted sweater is such a get. If moths, staining, and pilling haven’t already claimed a pre-worn sweater, it’s like a gift from the gods. And no sweater better exemplifies the alt cred a thrifted cardigan can bestow like the one Kurt Cobain wore for MTV’s <a href=#>Unplugged</a>. Firstly, the grunge era was huge for layering as a whole. Flannels, sweaters, jean jackets — sometimes all three in the same outfit over bike shorts. It was a lawless time. Secondly, that thing is so bedraggled. The studio lighting catches the pills on Kurt’s sweater just like the flyaways in his hair. It’s a studied, shabby look, one that became hagiography after he died. Kurt’s sweater look was so iconic that it resonated with MTV a full decade after Unplugged. MTV’s Made came to my school, and the guy from Yellowcard mentored this kid in a battle of the bands. The punks at my school protested the event, and Guy From Yellowcard told his mentee, “Don’t let these fucking hipsters and their Salvation Army sweaters get you down.” Truer words were never spoken. —Bethy Squires</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmthl3jq006w3b7hvogyae26@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Rory’s “muumuu” sweater in Gilmore Girls</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/08e/46f/74d656d202689cf8642cf8aa1abcac41f8-gilmore-girls-warner-bros.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmthjayq004v3b7hgeabq29b@published data-word-count=108>When I was 11 and watching <a href=#>Gilmore Girls</a> for the first time, Lorelai Gilmore was the epitome of cool. If she liked something, it was good, and if she hated something, it was bad. That extended to her taste in movies and music, her distaste for her blue-blooded family and their wealth, and crucially, an oversize fisherman sweater Rory wears in the pilot. “What’s with the muumuu?” Lorelai asks disdainfully. The die was cast: Big sweaters were not cool. Rewatching (and rewatching, and rewatching, and rewatching) Gilmore Girls as an adult, I am horrified by Lorelai’s snobbery and pettiness.

A psychotic nanny!), and former Los Angeles Laker Rick Fox played a former Los Angeles Laker turned loan shark. There were kidnappings and abductions and secret children and surprise marriages. It was basically a primetime soap opera in which no romantic relationship or dangerous subplot was too unthinkable. Yet amid all that schlock, what lingers in my brain most is this thing they made <a href=#>Bethany Joy Lenz</a> wear. What is it? Ostensibly, this is a floral-knit poncho; in reality, it’s like an AI program tried to copy a Delia’s catalogue. Lenz’s character, Haley James, starts off this series as a nerdy tutor — “unattractive” in the same way Rachel Leigh Cook was supposed to be in She’s All That because she was wearing glasses — but even by those early-aughts standards, this doily is a war crime.

Does God even give a damn about the tragic death of <a href=#>Jenny, the world’s most perfect miniature donkey</a>? You already know the answer to that, and Banshees makes you sit with it. The movie’s dreary setting — all gray skies and empty country roads — would be relentlessly oppressive if not for the bold-colored sweaters worn by Pàdraic (Colin Farrell), a mildly obnoxious sweetie who likes to reassure himself that he’s only the second-dumbest person on the island. Every time Pàdraic attempts to reconcile with Colm (Brendan Gleeson), he seems to be wearing an even cozier piece of knitwear, as if daring his cold-hearted former friend to reject someone who’s practically begging to be cuddled. His efforts culminate with this wide-collared burgundy number, which he deftly styles both with and without a blazer despite (presumably) never having read a single menswear magazine. It’s the perfect outfit to highlight Pàdraic’s too much-ness — he’s almost too cute, and certainly too clueless to know when he’s being annoying. —Chris Stanton</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmtk3hht00e03b7hpl0vev45@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Kate Chastain’s sheep sweater vest in The Traitors</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/f32/87d8cd86fe07efbde7cd3ef52f3f18c466-traitors.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmtk3hhv00e13b7hrbwjtgt8@published data-word-count=92>After years of gracing our screens in blue polos, Kate Chastain didn’t waste the fashion opportunity of appearing on The Traitors.

Sweaters, it seems, are the ideal item to wear when living in a remote lighthouse and stealing a baby who conveniently washes up nearby. My particular favorite is the sweater coat that Vikander’s character wears after arriving on the island and consummating her marriage, a chunky and absolutely darling knit affair that looks less like something you’d wear while feeding the chickens and more like it would cost $500 from Jenni Kayne. It’s particularly fetching when layered over crisp cotton blouses and nightgown-like shifts, oversize enough to droop daintily from the shoulders.

But the film’s best sweater is worn by Owen Wilson’s Hansel <a href=#>when he crashes the funeral of Zoolander’s former roommates</a> after their orange mocha Frappuccino accident. Until Hansel shows up, all eyes are on Derek, in his flashy all-white outfit at the podium, preparing to break some earth-shattering news. But it’s Hansel’s sweater —&nbsp;appropriately black and understated, yet bold in its own way with that skeletal white stitching — that not only steals the limelight but solidifies a rivalry that blossoms into a friendship that ultimately saves the world.

Every detail is impeccable, especially the fact that sweater Santa appears to have Scott Calvin’s face, raising so many questions about his identity.

All the systemic injustice and inequality, and the American Dream crumbling and dying under late-stage capitalism and infrastructure failures— and maybe David Simon’s outlandish Twitter persona — are more front of mind. For the most part, the series’s ensemble was wearing cop uniforms or streetwear, depending on which side of the law they were on, and that’s why Frank Sabotka’s sweater stands out. Chris Bauer’s Stevedores patriarch is one of the series’s most tragic figures, a man who knows his industry is dying and that none of the allies he’s made —&nbsp;the European gangsters he’s working with, the Baltimore politicians he’s bribe — are going to step up to save the docks and the jobs they provide to Baltimore’s working class. It’s not that his sweater signifies that sense of giving up. But the nondescriptness of it — that muddy plaid, the zhlubby fit — support Sabotka’s initially shrugging evasiveness, his aw-shucks everyman-ness. He wears the sweater when <a href=#>he lies to investigators</a> about how a shipping container full of dead trafficked women ended up at his dock, certain the benevolent image he’s cultivated over the years will help him escape another tricky situation. It doesn’t work, but Sabotka’s sweater and how thoroughly average it is complements his later bitterness about what America has become: “We used to make shit in this country. Build shit. Now we just put our hands in the next guy’s pocket.” That ugly knit is really a shroud — not just for Sabotka, but for Simon’s idea of what America used to be. —R.H.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clmthjcab005n3b7hzqk6fjto@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Daniel Craig (various sweaters)</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1d8/736/b21aeeafd16305b9adac8aaf704834f6d0-girl-dragon-tattoo-columbia.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clmthjays00553b7hlckn3rb7@published data-word-count=156>When Daniel Craig comes to mind, one is likely to think of the many fashion accouterments associated with his lengthy tenure as James Bond: <a href=#>luxury watches</a>, suits, <a href=#>understated khakis</a>.

At first, it may seem like the sweaters’ sole purpose is to make Guillermo seem dowdy and out of touch. But this is more than just dated clothing. These are the kinds of sweaters a mother puts on a child because she thinks it’s fun and the child cannot stop her. It’s the kind of thing a dedicated aunt hand-knits over the course of months so you basically have to wear it —&nbsp;the sorts of pieces that come to a person through a relative’s death or storage-unit liquidation, hung onto because why throw away a perfectly good sweater? It is a sartorial embodiment of Guillermo’s own lived predicament: a once-loved item that is now met with disdain and annoyance when it appears. I have always enjoyed thinking of Guillermo as a beleaguered Hollywood assistant or intern waiting for a promotion that’s never going to come, a person trying desperately to impress people who inherently do not see him as their equal and never will. Just like the sweaters, no matter how intricate his patterns, he will never be fashionable.

The Dude’s outfits are, pretty clearly, thrifted and stretched out and splotched with spilled White Russians. His knitwear, though — that’s a keeper, a quality piece that leaps off the screen, with a thick shawl collar that would flatter virtually anyone. It’s called the Westerley sweater, introduced in 1972 by Pendleton Woolen Mills, a great American company that has been in the same Oregon family for 151 years, and it gives the Dude just enough layering to defend against a mildly cool Los Angeles evening or a slightly over-air-conditioned bowling center. The pattern and style are of the type known as a Cowichan, after the knits made by the Indigenous people of Vancouver Island. Brown-on-brown Pendleton sweaters used to be strictly secondhand-store dollar-bin stuff, but of course that changed when the cosplayers started paying attention. eBay sellers now ask $250 or so for this particular model. Pendleton itself wisely now sells a meticulously detailed, if pricey, reissue, down to the vintage-style ring pull on the zipper.

But then the camera pans down from Firth’s handsome face to a green turtleneck jumper with a large, goofy cartoon reindeer. “Maybe not.” Unfortunately for Darcy, it would be years before ugly Christmas sweaters became a staple of holiday wardrobes, and his fashion choice becomes fodder for the many barbed comments Bridget throws his way during the film. Fortunately for them both, this rom-com is a twist on Pride & Prejudice, and by the end of the movie, they have both gotten over their bad first impressions.

It is the exact shade of red that an autumnal jumper should be: not orangey-red or fire-engine red but a pure crimson worthy of Snow White’s apple or Taylor Swift’s lips. It is cozy but a little sexy, baggy but tapered perfectly, and mildly alluring without suggesting that Sally is trying to be alluring. I believe Sally very deliberately decided to wear this sweater and that almost-skort before she even called Harry to ask for help.
