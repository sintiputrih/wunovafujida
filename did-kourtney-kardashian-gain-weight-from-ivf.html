However, being such a big star in the public eye doesn't come without judgment, with many stars being heavily judged on their appearance. Despite this, it seems as though Kourtney has been feeling very positive about her own perception of herself.</p><h2 id=kourtney-has-struggled-in-the-past-with-comments-about-her-body>Kourtney Has Struggled In The Past With Comments About Her Body</h2><p>Anyone who's watched the Kardashians on reality TV likely knows that Kourtney is a huge fan of vegan and organic food, and <a href=#>even encourages her children to eat the same healthy diet that she follows</a>.</p><p>She has also <a href=#>previously expressed her interest in the keto diet in 2018</a>, even trying it out herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, despite always looking what most would consider 'picture perfect', the star has shared that she has still struggled at times with comments from others about her appearance.</p><p>One example of this is in 2020, when a fan commented on one of her posts, where she was pictured lounging in a bikini, stating that the star was pregnant.</p><p>Kourtney quickly responded to the false claim, stating: “This is me when I have a few extra pounds on, and I actually love it. I have given birth three amazing times and this is the shape of my body.”</p><p>These sentiments were reflected in a recent episode of The Kardashians, when the star inferred that it can be tough seeing so many comments on her social media about her weight. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She has also admitted that she has previously become 'focused on the numbers</a> on the scale'.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Kourtney Kardashian’s Poosh Guides Fans Through 15 At-Home Workouts For A Hot Summer Body">Kourtney Kardashian’s Poosh Guides Fans Through 15 At-Home Workouts For A Hot Summer Body</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Such statements suggest that the reality TV star may feel self-conscious at times due to such comments, affecting the way that she feels about her body image.</p><p>However, she also stated that since being with Travis, he has made her 'so into' her new body, indicating that she may actually now be feeling more comfortable in her own body and her own skin compared to when she wasn't with the Blink-182 drummer.</p><h2 id=kourtney-much-prefers-her-body-now-because-when-she-was-skinny-she-was-unhappy>Kourtney Much Prefers Her Body Now Because When She Was Skinny, She Was Unhappy</h2><p>Despite not feeling as positive about her body image in the past, it would appear that Kourtney is much more at peace in her own skin now.</p><p>In the same episode of The Kardashians, she reflected upon her previous weight in a confessional, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confessing that she was only ever skinny when she was 'unhappy'</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title='Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker&#39;s PDA Is "Awkward" For Scott Disick'>Kourtney Kardashian And Travis Barker's PDA Is "Awkward" For Scott Disick</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm so into my thicker body.

I think it's taken me a lot to get me to the place of feeling really comfortable and happy with the changes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her body-positive mentality has been radiated online to her fans, who have commended her attitude. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans on Reddit left comments</a> applauding the reality star.</p><p>One fan wrote: "Honestly, this is the reason why Kourt is the only KarJenner I follow on IG. She actually makes me feel good about my body because she doesn't Photoshop her pics the way her sisters do.
