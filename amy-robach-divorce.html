This has a profound effect on the partnership. It doesn’t have to cost a lot, but it will be well worth it.</p><p>The native Michiganders praised their parenting style. We’d rather put our money toward activities than stuff. “It’s easy to lose track of those details,” she admitted. One of the most meaningful things I’ve ever done with my money and time was to take my daughters to a Broadway show for Christmas instead of buying them clothes. There is no way to erase or restore memory.</p><p>The couple used their story as the basis for a children’s book that came out in October of 2021. Robach and Shue told Publisher’s Weekly in an interview that month that they had written stories about the animals in their backyard forming a family and going on adventures together when they were going through the process of blending their families.
