And the Browns welcomed their second child (Alyssa was pregnant when they filmed the Shark Tank episode).</p><p>The Moki Door Step is a vehicle attachment that is compatible with any car. It hooks to the door latch of a car and allows someone to easily and safely access the roof of their car to load skis, bikes, kayaks, and more. Both feet can fit on the doorstep, permitting balance and safety for anyone who needs to access the top of their car.</p><p>As soon as Zach demonstrated the product the sharks were amazed by how easy it was to attach the step to the door.

The step hooks into the “strike” of the car which the entrepreneur claims exists in most vehicles.</p><p>When they expressed that, they would be more likely to sell the company than to take an investor at that value, Daymond jumped on the idea and offered the entrepreneurs the cash amount of the value they proposed at the start of the deal,<strong> $3,000,000</strong> for the whole kit and caboodle. The entrepreneurs accepted and Daymond made one of the few buyouts in the show’s history!</p><p>Up until this deal, Daymond had invested a paltry<strong> $25,000</strong> into one deal, Cup Board Pro, a deal that he had gone into with four other sharks. In fact, in nine episodes, this was only his fourth appearance! Were we losing Daymond John as a shark? Was he no longer interested in the show?</p><h2>What is a Moki door step?</h2><p>The Moki Doorstep is<strong> an aircraft-grade aluminum step made to reach the rooftop of the car.</strong> Zach and Alyssa Brown a married couple from Newington came up with the idea to help people who can’t reach the rooftop of the car.

Zach further states the step can hold up to 400 pounds of weight.</p><p>They launched their product in 2017 with a Kickstarter campaign which helped them raise<strong> $11,000</strong> with the help of 2000 backers. Zach brown himself had invested $300,000 in the business. Another $300,000 was invested by his uncle who was to be paid $1 per gear for 18 years.</p><p>Upon asking about the investors Zach revealed that his uncle has invested<strong> $300,000</strong> and receives $1 per gear sold. Kevin thought the valuation of the company was high.
