The losers end up in more debt than they started with. Da-jung, desperate to pay off their debts, agrees to take part in the game, but they quickly find that the other players will do anything to win, forcing Da-jung to play dirty.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Unlike&nbsp;Squid Game,&nbsp;Liar Game&nbsp;is less gory and more psychological, featuring a lot of gambits and trickery as the players try to out-logic each other.
