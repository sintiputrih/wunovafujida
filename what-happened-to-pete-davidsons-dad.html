It's enough to stifle someone's entire life if they can't find a way to accept it. There's no doubt that the <a href=#>Saturday Night Liv</a>e star has felt the pain of the incalculable loss of his firefighter father, Scott, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">during the attack on The World Trade Center in September 2001</a>. But Pete has also found an authentic and healthy way of making this terrible day part of the man he's become.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Instead of wallowing in self-pity or refusing to get out of bed in the morning, the stand-up comic works his father's tragic death into his act. He also made a movie about it called The King Of Staten Island. But it's more Pete's sense of humor that reveals how he's coped with it.</p><p>Pete's often cringe-worthy dark comedy isn't for everyone. But it is a sign that he doesn't take his pain too seriously. He has a perspective on it, and he's not afraid to humanize it. As former Late Late Show host, Craig Ferguson once said, making fun of the worst aspects of life makes them seem a little less daunting. Here are some instances when Pete absolutely proved (in some pretty shocking and offensive ways) that he has a very evolved perspective on his father's death...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-davidson-39-s-joke-on-the-howard-stern-show><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Pete Davidson's Joke On The Howard Stern Show</span></h2><p>Pete Davidson clearly wasn't afraid to make light of the dark when he was interviewed on The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show for the first time. This was when he was still dating <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>. During the interview, he addressed the topic of having intercourse with such an attractive woman. While we can't quote Pete's joke here, he essentially said that he is able to hold out with Ariana in bed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by thinking about his father's death</a>.</p><p>This is obviously a very dark joke for a crowd that loves that type of humor. But it's also a sign that Pete's way of dealing with this horrible event is to poke fun at it.</p><h2 id=pete-39-s-reaction-to-jimmy-carr-39-s-shocking-about-his-father><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pete's Reaction To Jimmy Carr's Shocking About His Father</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some fans thought that Jimm Carr's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> joke about Pete Davidson's father was "absolutely sickening"</a>. But Pete Davidson didn't. In fact, Jimmy Carr has said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he got permission</a> from the Saturday Night Live star before he made the extremely edgy joke at The Comedy Central Roast of Rob Lowe. For those who don't know, the British comedian said this about his fellow roaster:</p><p>"I'm appalled that people would come here and make jokes about the sacrifice Pete's heroic father made on 9/11. This is not the roast of Pete Davidson's father. That was in 2001."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Pete Davidson Is Ready To Be a Dad, Says Adoption Is Possible</a></span></p><p>Prior to doing the joke at the roast, Jimmy even tested it out at a comedy club where Pete was present. So, while some audience members gasped and groaned when they heard it, it's clear that Pete really didn't care. In fact, he thought the joke was damn funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-doesn-39-t-hold-his-father-up-as-a-perfect-person><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Pete Doesn't Hold His Father Up As A Perfect Person</span></h2><p>There's no doubt that Scott Davidson was a hero. And Pete never denies this. But he doesn't shy away from showing all sides of Scott in his comedy routine. On numerous occasions, Pete has shared some very human stories of his father. This includes one that a friend of Scott's told Pete about his father spying on his friend jumping into bed with another woman.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Pete Davidson The Youngest Guy Kim Kardashian Has Dated?</a></span></p><p>"[My dad's friend's] like, 'Isn't that a great story?'

During an interview with Sky News, Pete explained why he did this: "As someone who's open with struggles and issues, I think I'm always learning and growing. Making this film allowed me to grow more as a person."</p><p>He continued by saying, "One of the main reasons why I wanted to make this movie and tell this story was because I wanted this chapter in my life to be closed. Not forgotten, but I wanted to be able to move on and show that it's okay to have issues and it's okay to struggle and that you're not alone and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Pete Davidson’s Pals Don’t Want Him On “The Kardashians,” Claiming It “Decimates Every Man”</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brzErZxmnJGrtqW%2FzqeqZpyRmXw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./made-in-chelsea-miles-age.html>&#171;&nbsp; Made in Chelsea star Miles Nazaire: Age, Instagram, parents and more!
