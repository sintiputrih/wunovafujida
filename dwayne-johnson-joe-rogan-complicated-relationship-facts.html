Back in the day, Johnson made a few appearances on the 'Howard Stern Show', which could be a considered a rival of Joe Rogan's in this day and age.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Joe Rogan Refuses To Appear On This Show Despite Fans Wanting Otherwise</a></span></p><p>Fans remain hopeful that DJ might finally appear on the podcast - the actor himself has expressed interest in the past on going on the show, especially due to all the requests from the fans.

However, the hype was all short-lived, as some anti-Joe Rogan followers bashed DJ for his comment, especially given some of Rogan's other controversies from the past.</p><p>DJ would later take back his comments in the days that followed because of more controversy.</p><h2 id=dwayne-johnson-changed-his-opinion-on-joe-rogan-following-a-tweet-by-don-winslow>Dwayne Johnson Changed His Opinion On Joe Rogan Following A Tweet By Don Winslow</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was Don Winslow, an international best-selling author that might've caused complications in Johnson and Rogan's relationship. He tweeted out, "Dear @TheRock, You're a hero to many people and using your platform to defend Joe Rogan, a guy that used and laughed about using the N word dozens of times, is a terrible use of your power. Have you actually listened to this man's many racist statements about Black people?"</p><p>DJ would respond to the tweet, revealing that he hadn't known about the allegations, "Dear @donwinslow, Thank you so much for this I hear you as well as everyone here 100% I was not aware of his N word use prior to my comments, but now I've become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me. Mahalo, brother and have a great & productive weekend. DJ."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Joe Rogan did address the matter in the past,</a> making mention that he has nothing but regret for using the word, while also revealing that he is not racist. "Now, I haven’t said it in years, but for a long time, when I would bring that word up, like, if it would come up in conversation and instead of saying the n-word, I would just say the word — I thought as long as it was in context, people would understand what I was doing,” he explained.</p><p>Given The Rock's words and what was recently revealed, it seems as though it may have put a huge dent in a relationship that was at one point a close one behind the scenes.</p><p>DJ appearing on the podcast seems less likely.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>This Musician Turned Down A Guest Spot On 'The Joe Rogan Experience'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibsJmpo7Juts6hpaynnmK3sLGMq6agmZ5isLC5z6WgnJmkmrFuvsSlmK2hn6PAqbXPZp2am6SofA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-to-pronounce-glenmorangie-signet.html>&#171;&nbsp;How to pronounce glenmorangie signet</a>
