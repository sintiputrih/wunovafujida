icon<p><b>Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</b> (also referred to as <b>Pokémon TCG Online</b> or <b>TCGO</b>) was a <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>downloadable game</a> and the first Pokémon game outside Japan of the MMOTCG (massively-multiplayer online trading card game) genre. It was based on the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> or TCG aspect of the Pokémon franchise and follows the same rules. The game was originally released as a browser-based game in March 2011 before being relaunched as a downloadable game in 2012 for Windows and macOS, iOS on iPad in 2014, and Android tablets in 2016. It officially emerged from open beta testing in February 2015 but continued to be refined and improved upon on a continual basis. The game was free to download and is accessible to both beginners and experienced players. It was also intended to be used by both adults and <a href=#>children</a>.</p><p>Players do not need to purchase physical products from a store in order to play as they are provided with basic resources, and there are multiple means of <a href=#>earning new cards and other rewards</a> as the game is played. The game has all cards released internationally from the <a href=# title="HeartGold & SoulSilver (TCG)">HeartGold & SoulSilver</a> to the <a href=# title="Crown Zenith (TCG)">Crown Zenith</a> <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions">expansion</a>, with new products having been released in periodic updates.</p><p>On September 20, 2021, a successor titled <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game Live">Pokémon Trading Card Game Live</a> was announced. On June 5, 2023, TCG Online become unavailable for download and its servers were shutdown, in anticipation of TCG Live's official launch on June 8, 2023.<a href=#>[1]</a> Players of TCG Online will be able to transfer certain cards and items to TCG Live - this transfer could be performed during TCG Live's beta, or after TCG Online's shutdown, with no deadline until further notice.<a href=#>[2]</a></p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Guided_story>Guided story</span></h2><p>So as to not overwhelm new and returning players with the complexity of the full game and in order to assist less experienced players in learning basic game mechanics, all players are initially directed through a set of in-game Tutorials and then a set of <a href=# title="Appendix:Glossary (TCG)">matches</a> before all game features are accessible. Then, the player is directed to the <a href=#>Trainer Challenge</a> but can ignore it and already use the other game's modes. Players already familiar with the game may bypass the tutorials by disabling the <i>"New User Experience"</i> under <a href=#>Options</a>.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Play_modes>Play modes</span></h2><p>There are four primary Play modes available: Tutorial, Trainer Challenge, Versus Mode and Events Mode. Additionally, Friend Battle and Play Testing are available under the Social menu and the Deck Manager respectively. Except for the tutorials, each mode is playable in one or more of the below deck formats:</p><a href=# title="Theme format (TCG)">Theme</a> <i>Main article: <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game Online decks">List of Pokémon Trading Card Game Online decks</a></i> Only preconstructed Theme decks are allowed in this play type. Apart from the player's initial decks, Theme decks are obtained by either using <a href=#>Redemption codes</a> or by purchase with <a href=#>Trainer Tokens</a> in the in-game <a href=#>Shop</a>. Currently, new players have access to five Theme decks (plus <a href=# title="X & Y - Basic Yellow (TCG)">XY Basic Yellow</a> only in the tutorials) exclusive to the <i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</i>, but other <a href=# title="Theme Deck (TCG)">unique Theme decks</a> were available in the past. Official <a href=# title="Theme Deck (TCG)">Theme Decks</a> from the <a href=# title="HeartGold & SoulSilver (TCG)">HeartGold & SoulSilver</a> <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions">expansion</a> onward can also be played in this format. <a href=# title="Standard format (TCG)">Standard</a> Only decks composed entirely of cards from expansions or sets officially sanctioned for <a href=# title="Play! Pokémon">Play! Pokémon</a> events for the Standard format are allowed in this play type. The list of allowed expansions is updated with a game patch shortly after as the official, annual <a href=# title="Rotation (TCG)">Rotation</a> is announced. Expansions are added to the <a href=# title="Standard format (TCG)">Standard format</a> as they are released (typically four a year), and the oldest legal expansions are rotated out of the Standard format on an annual basis. The Standard format was previously called the Modified format. <a href=# title="Expanded format (TCG)">Expanded</a> Only decks composed entirely of cards from expansions or sets officially sanctioned for Play! Pokémon events for the Expanded format are allowed in this play type. This format was added in the 2014-2015 season to allow a greater number of expansions than the Standard format but not be as unpredictable in card combinations as the Unlimited format. The list of allowed expansions is updated with a game patch shortly after as the official, annual Rotation is announced. Expansions are added to the Expanded format as they are released. <a href=# title="Unlimited format (TCG)">Unlimited</a> Any deck composed of cards currently available in the game are allowed in this play type. This format was retired from Versus/Events Mode on March 30th, 2016, now only being accessible through Friend Battles. <a href=# title="Legacy format (TCG)">Legacy</a> Only decks composed of cards from <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">HeartGold & SoulSilver</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Black & White</a> Series can be played in this format. This format replaced the Unlimited format in the Versus Mode as a way to allow players to use old cards without having to face "broken" decks such as the <a href=# title="Shiftry Donk (TCG)">Shiftry Donk</a> archetype. This format is exclusive to TCGO.<h3><span class=mw-headline id=Tutorial_Mode>Tutorial Mode</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Tutorial (TCGO)">Tutorial (TCGO)</a></i><p>After being welcomed to the <a href=# title="Game Store">Game Store</a>, <a href=# title="Professor Holly">Professor Holly</a> guides the player through matches designed to teach players the basics of game play with assistance.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Trainer_Challenge>Trainer Challenge</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Game Store">Game Store</a></i><p>In the Trainer Challenge, players face various computer-controlled <a href=# title="Game Store">Trainer</a> characters using their owned <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game Online decks">Theme decks</a>. Players battle in three "Leagues": Gold League, Platinum League, and City Championship. Players must defeat a given Trainer in a specific spot or position once before unlocking the next Trainer position, as well finishing a given league once before unlocking the next. Some Trainers appear more than once in a league. Unlike more traditional <a href=# title="Play! Pokémon">tournaments</a> such as Events Mode, players that have been defeated may pickup right where they left off rather than start all over again. They are also able to rematch a Trainer that has already been defeated in any league position.</p><p>Winning matches against Trainers with different decks earn players stars (maximum four per opponent) that unlock rewards and changes the composition of that opponent's deck to increase difficulty:</p><ul><li>1 Star = 1 <a href=#>Trainer Token</a> (per Trainer opponent), Trainer's difficulty increases to "Medium"</li><li>2 Stars = 3 Trainer Tokens (per Trainer opponent)</li><li>3 Stars = 10 Trainer Tokens (per Trainer opponent), Trainer's difficulty increases to "Hard"</li><li>4 Stars = 1 non-tradable, 10-card <a href=# title="Booster pack (TCG)">Booster pack</a> from the current <a href=# title="Standard format (TCG)">Standard format</a> (per Trainer opponent)</li><li>Additionally, players obtain 3 more non-tradable, 10-card Booster packs from the current Standard format by earning 4 Stars with all 12 Trainers in a league for 9 more Booster packs.</li></ul><p>These Trainer Tokens and 45 total Booster packs are only obtained once per account.</p><p>Players must defeat 7 Trainers with the same Starter Theme deck (except for the <a href=# title="X & Y - Basic Yellow (TCG)">XY Basic Yellow</a> Theme deck) to fully unlock all the cards in that deck. Beating the same Trainer in a different position in a league or in a different leagues counts toward the 7 successes, but not beating a Trainer in the same position in a league more than once.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Versus_Mode>Versus Mode</span></h3><p>Versus Mode allows players to play against another randomly selected online player in the Theme, Standard, Expanded or Legacy format. Players earn a single <a href=#>Trainer Token</a> for each match played (<i>"Expert Matchmaking Reward"</i>), provided they have met <a href=#>minimum playtime requirements</a>, plus 2 Trainer Tokens if they win a match versus a player who was above their online <a href=#>rank</a>. Additionally, players are given the chance to spin the <a href=#>Bonus Wheel</a> regardless of the match's outcome, which provides an opportunity to receive Trainer Tokens, <a href=#>Event Tickets</a>, or a <a href=#>Mystery Box</a> reward.</p><p>Winning a match also earns players Versus Points, which advance players along a <a href=#>Versus Ladder</a> reward system.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Events_Mode>Events Mode</span></h3><p>Entry into Events, formerly referred to as "Tournaments", require either <a href=#>Event Tickets</a> or <a href=#>Trainer Tokens</a>. Events of different Deck formats are always available to join. Playing in events with other players provides the opportunity to gain Trainer Tokens or additional Event Tickets with a spin on the <a href=#>Bonus Wheel</a> at the end of each match, win or lose, as well as the opportunity to earn Trainer Tokens, Event Tickets, <a href=# title="Booster pack (TCG)">Booster packs</a>, and <a href=#>Uncommon Chests</a> based on player placement in a given event.</p><p>Each event is composed of three-round single elimination matches between 8 players. Upon entering an event, players are placed into a queue until all 8 players have been joined. Then, the event will begin and a new queue for other players will be created. The maximum duration of an event is 1 hour and 17 minutes with up to 25 minutes minutes per match (12 and ½ minutes per player) and one minute between rounds.</p><p>Usually only Theme, Standard and Expanded format events are available, as the Legacy format has a low playerbase and Unlimited has a reputation of turn one win decks.</p><p>Entry costs and rewards vary widely for special events.

With the return of these items to the shop, the release of Weekly Shop Bundles has been discontinued.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Trading>Trading</span></h2><p>The Trade system allows players to view and create public and private trade offers in-game. Players may trade one or several items, cards, and packs in each transaction. Not every item is available for trading (appearing as "Trade Locked" items) to prevent players from creating multiple accounts to accumulate these items.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Socialization>Socialization</span></h2><p>The Social menu lets players search for online Friends, participate in Public Chats and review in-game notifications. It is one of two navigation system options available while players are competing in a Pokémon Trading Card Game match, although its feature set is adjusted to reflect the in progress match context.</p><p>Players can send friend requests to others, which allows them to engage in Friend Battles or private message them. They also have the option to block other players from interacting with them for any reason within the game, including the chat and Versus Mode matches.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Other_features>Other features</span></h2><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Rotating_features>Rotating features</span></h3><p>Many in-game features are refreshed or change on a recurring basis:</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Avatar_Creator>Avatar Creator</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="Avatar Item">Avatar Item</a></i><p>The player's avatar is a purely cosmetic feature.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Gameplay_items>Gameplay items</span></h3><p>Gameplay items include Card sleeves, <a href=# title="Coin (TCG)">Coins</a>, and Deck boxes and are purely cosmetic. They may be purchased from time to time in the in-game shop, available through <a href=#>Redemption codes</a> provided with the purchase of physical products or may be traded for with other players. Playmats are currently unavailable in the game, despite an option to select one in the Deck Manager indicates that they may become available in the future.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Child_accounts>Child accounts</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title=Pokémon.com>Pokémon.com, User profile</a></i><p>While the <i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</i> strives to be child friendly, parents may further restrict access to certain in-game features by signing into the parent's account on <a href=# title=Pokémon.com>Pokémon.com</a>, selecting the child's account under the parent account, and selecting Pokémon TCG Online Settings. Some in-game features are inaccessible in child accounts, such as Public Chat and Private Messaging, while other in-game features are restricted by limiting available options.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Guest_Mode>Guest Mode</span></h3><p>The game can be played without a <a href=# title="Pokémon Trainer Club">Pokémon Trainer Club</a> account, but features such as Events Mode and avatar customization are disabled for guest players.

At the beginning of matches, the highest-ranking player is identified to have an "Advantage" over their opponent. The leaderboard is <a rel=nofollow class="external text" href=#>public</a> and resets inside the game every three weeks.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Miscellaneous>Miscellaneous</span></h3>Match Inactivity If the server determines that players are inactive too long in Versus or Events Mode, it will display a 15 second warning. Ignoring the warning causes players to lose matches. This activity mechanism is designed to help insure players do not take advantage of another player. Minimum Playtime Requirement During Versus and Events Mode matches, <a href=#>Trainer Tokens</a> and <a href=#>Bonus Wheel</a> rewards are only earned if matches last at least 2 minutes or 5 minutes for forfeiting players, which guarantees a reward to the opponent regardless of time spent. This change was designed to discourage players for only playing long enough to earn their rewards. Loss of Internet Connection During online matches in Events Mode, players that lose their internet connection have 5 minutes to log back into the game before their opponent is declared the winner. When the internet connection is lost by an opponent, players are notified with a pop-up message.<h2><span class=mw-headline id=Retired_game_features>Retired game features</span></h2><p>The <i>Pokémon Trading Card Game Online</i> has been in continual development since its initial inception. Often updates involve the addition of new rules and card as new <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions">expansion</a> sets are released, the resolution of program errors, player interface changes improving usability, and the addition or re-addition of new game features. Occasionally, updates to the game involve the removal of previously existing game features.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Booster_Credits>Booster Credits</span></h3><p>This former in-game <a href=#>Currency</a> was originally used with Redemption code cards found in physical <a href=# title="Booster pack (TCG)">Booster packs</a>.

This Redemption code card method ended with the release of the <a href=# title="Plasma Storm (TCG)">Plasma Storm</a> expansion when codes from a specific <a href=# title="List of Pokémon Trading Card Game expansions">expansion</a> Booster pack became redeemable for a virtual version of that specific Booster pack. The Booster Credit system officially ended on July 1, 2013. Players who still had remaining Booster Credits after the February 7, 2014 update automatically had their credits redeemed for Boundaries Crossed Booster packs.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Diamond_League>Diamond League</span></h3><p>A higher league, fourth "Diamond League" existed in the <a href=#>Trainer Challenge</a> prior to the February 7, 2014 update.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Practice_Battle>Practice Battle</span></h3><p>Practice Battle was originally an option in <a href=#>Versus Mode</a> found under Ranked Battle. Practice Battle matches did not count toward player <a href=#>Player rank</a> or let the player earn rewards.
