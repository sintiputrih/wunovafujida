Yet the beauty staple was only introduced into Taylor's repertoire in 2009, when she posed for an Allure cover. While chatting with Hoda and Jenna on Today With Hoda & Jenna, makeup artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gucci Westman discussed Taylor Swift's first red lip moment</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/all-of-taylor-swift-s-famous-exes-ranked-by-how-much-fans-loved-them-together-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together">All Of Taylor Swift's Famous Exes, Ranked By How Much Fans Loved Them Together</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has dated celebrities like Harry Styles, John Mayer and Calvin Harris, and her fans have plenty of thoughts about each relationship.</p><p>Westman said she had the idea of slathering Taylor in red lipstick simply because she hadn't seen the young starlet wear the color before.</p><p>Though she happily recounted the birth of Taylor's biggest makeup moment for an interview, Gucci Westman didn't give away all of Taylor's lipstick secrets. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Westman also noted in an Instagram throwback</a> years later that she sent Taylor home with her own tube of red lipstick, but didn't say what brand it was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Westman may have started the trend, but she's far from the only makeup artist to slather red lipstick on Ms. Swift. In 2022, Pat McGrath — the makeup artist behind Taylor's "Bejeweled" video, 2010 Met Gala, and 2022 VMAs looks — said that Taylor is the ideal canvas for a red lip look.</p><p>Pat used three shades of lip pencil for "Bejeweled," plus her seeming trademark Elson lip color.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McGrath also sells a product called "The 'Taylor-Made Lip Kit',"</a> which includes a MatteTrance lipstick in Elson (Blue Red) and a PermaGel Ultra Lip Pencil in Night Fever (Bright Pink). McGrath calls this Taylo's "on-set lip duo," which seems to suggest that Taylor wears the color combo for performances.</p><p>The red lipstick became a trademark of Taylor's, but it also drew attention to her mouth; <a href=#>fans worried over Taylor's smile even after she had her teeth fixed</a>. Today, she seems to have a shiny new smile to go along with her bold lipstick.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-39-s-swift-39-s-mom-was-not-happy-about-the-red-lipstick>Taylor's Swift's Mom Was Not Happy About The Red Lipstick</h2><h3 id=andrea-swift-argued-in-favor-of-a-more-neutral-style-for-taylor>Andrea Swift argued in favor of a more neutral style for Taylor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/untitled-design-2024-02-16t125806-910.jpg><p>The red lipstick clearly caught on, and Taylor began wearing it more often, leading fans to start imitating the look.
