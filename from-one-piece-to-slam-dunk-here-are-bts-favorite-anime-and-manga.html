Some of them are even weebs and are just as obsessed with anime as we are. Lately, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we’ve seen multiple artists sharing their favorite anime and characters with fans more than ever before</a>. It became a phenomenon. But do you know who’s also been quite vocal about their anime love before this new wave? That’s right, K-Pop’s trendsetting weebs, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BTS</a></strong>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>After nearly a decade, every ARMY ought to know how the members are absolute geeks. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jin is obsessed with indie video games</a>, Jungkook has Marvel figurines at his place, and RM is surely active on Book Twitter; so, their absolute and complete obsession with anime doesn’t come as a surprise. With that said, here are BTS’ favorite anime.</p><h2 id=h-jujutsu-kaisen data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Gojo-Jujutsu-Kaise.jpg><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>Jujutsu Kaisen is the talk of the hour, with everyone and their mothers glued to the screen (or the pages) for the latest episodes and chapters from Gege Akutami’s magnum opus. However, the BTS member who most frequently boasts about JJK is none other than BTS own JJK himself, aka Jeon Jungkook. The youngest BTS member has often hosted live streams where he claimed Gojo as his favorite character in the anime, and shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his current hyper-fixation is Jujutsu Kaisen</a>. Relatable.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Haikyuu</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Haikyuu-hinata-kageyama.jpg><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=733 data-injectable=true>At least three BTS members have shown a thorough obsession with Haikyuu. The earliest mention came from V, who recommended fans watch Haikyuu during a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan Fanclub video</a>. He was often spotted watching the latest Haikyuu episodes during photoshoot breaks, showing where his priorities lie. Additionally, Jimin and Jungkook, the other two members who also enjoy Haikyuu, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned and imitated blocking</a> during episode 138 of RUN BTS!.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Mermaid Melody</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mermaid-Melody.jpg><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most unexpected entry on this list is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">none other than the Shojo mermaid anime, Mermaid Melody</a>. Lucia, Rina, and Hanon quite literally raised me, and it appears that they did the same for RM. During the VLive interview, when asked about the group’s favorite childhood anime, Namjoon quickly responded with Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch!. The answer took the rest of the members by surprise, and some even cackled at his choice, but not me, RM — I get you.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Slam Dunk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Slam-Dunk.jpg><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=781 data-injectable=true>We certainly appreciate some Slam Dunk love, and SUGA has consistently been the most vocal advocate for Takehiko Inoue’s masterpiece. In an old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VLive interview</a>, BTS was asked about their favorite childhood anime, with SUGA promptly mentioning Slam Dunk — unsurprisingly given the rapper’s passion for all things basketball. What’s more, during episode 66 of RUN BTS!, when the members were tasked with selecting a manga, SUGA once again chose Slam Dunk — duh.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Fullmetal Alchemist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Edward-Elric-Fullmetal-Alchemist-Brotherhood-e1678822423111.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=722 data-injectable=true>Jungkook is the only BTS member to declare Fullmetal Alchemist as one of his all-time favorite manga and anime. In episode 66 of RUN BTS!, Jungkook specifically chose the original 2001 manga by Hiromu Arakawa, telling the story of two young alchemist brothers: Alphonse and Edward. I wonder if he prefers <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the original 2003 anime or the 2009 remake</a> — though there is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">only one acceptable answer</a> in my very humble opinion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>One Piece</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/luffy-one-piece.jpg><p data-characters=631 data-current-count=931 data-injectable=true>For many avid BTS fans, it’s not surprising at all that most BTS members are huge One Piece fans. There are countless moments where BTS mentions One Piece, but I’ll highlight a few of my favorites. In the song “Cypher Pt.2: Triptych,” One Piece‘s Whitebeard is referenced — one of the rare anime mentions in the group’s music. Additionally, the maknae line — including Namjoon — are big One Piece fans. Jimin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been gifted One Piece merchandise multiple times</a>, including a Zoro figurine from Jungkook, and SUGA has given Jimin several One Piece manga sets. We all need friends like BTS.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Digimon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Digimon-Tai-and-Agumon.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>After J-Hope, Jin is very likely the least vocal about the anime he has been watching, possibly because he’s one of the members who watch the most anime of all. There is just too much to talk about. However, in the Vlive interview, Jin mentioned that Digimon was his favorite childhood anime to watch. Considering it was always getting re-runs on television, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s safe to say it was nearly everyone’s favorite anime at the time</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Dragon Ball</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dragon-ball.png><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>Quite a few members have also boasted about Dragon Ball — unsurprisingly. While not considered part of the big three of Shounen, Dragon Ball is quite up there on everyone’s list — especially for SUGA, Jimin, and Jin. It was also during Nosey’s interview that Jin said Dragon Ball was “a masterpiece,” with SUGA echoing the sentiment by vividly choosing Dragon Ball as his favorite of the options given. As for Jimin, the singer previously said that Dragon Ball <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was his favorite childhood anime</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Naruto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Naruto-.jpg><p data-characters=558 data-current-count=858 data-injectable=true>Naruto has been referenced over the years by several BTS members. In 2015, during a Halloween-themed concert, the members dressed as various pop culture figures, with SUGA’s Naruto cosplay becoming viral across the universe. In episode 28 of RUN BTS!, all the members enthusiastically sang along to one of Naruto’s openings in a very iconic performance, and a few years prior, in an interview by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Noisey</a>, Jungkook and J-Hope <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chose Naruto as their favorite anime</a> out of Dragon Ball, Naruto and One Piece. Taste but also, One Piece was right there.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>My Hero Academia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/izuku-midoriya-my-hero-academia.jpg><p data-characters=532 data-current-count=832 data-injectable=true>Every BTS fan knows, by now, that V is one of the biggest anime fans in the group. He constantly makes references to several anime behind the scenes, and one of the anime that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s often seen mentioning and watching is My Hero Academia</a>. In 2017, as the members got ready to perform on stage for the big MAMA awards, V was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">caught by the cameras</a> watching My Hero Academia on his laptop. A year later, during a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FujiTV </a>interview with BTS, once again, V talks about having just finished My Hero Academia and being a huge anime fan.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>My Guardian Characters</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/my-guardian-characters.jpg><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=806 data-injectable=true>This is<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of the few Shojo mentioned on this list</a>, and of course, it couldn’t belong to anyone other than the biggest babygirl in the group — Jungkook. During the VLive interview, Jungkook shared that his favorite childhood anime was My Guardian Characters. It’s a fantasy Shojo anime that is both wholesome and filled with magic — just like Jeon Jungkook, in his own way. Weirdly enough, Jungkook’s current favorite is possibly the biggest fight anime on television at the moment.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Chainsaw Man</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Chainsaw-Man.jpg><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=743 data-injectable=true>The <a href=#>internet nearly exploded when Jungkook started singing Chainsaw Man‘s opening</a> during a live stream, and we were right there alongside with them. The maknae of the group appears to like all the trendiest anime, and Chainsaw Man deserves all his attention. Aside from having Jujutsu Kaisen as his favorite anime at the moment, the 26-year-old appears to be quite a big fan of Chainsaw Man as well — just like any good Gen Z’er.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Pokémon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Team-Rocket-Pokemon1.jpg><p data-characters=634 data-current-count=934 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most members have also watched Pokémon</a>. Over the years, we’ve seen plushie toys and even Pokémon cards that some members collected through the years, but Jin and RM are clearly some of the biggest fans of this long-lasting franchise. Jin has shared several pictures of himself with his Pokémon plushies, while RM has shared pictures of his Pokémon card collection on Instagram — aside from his obsession with finding Pokémon bread. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Koreaboo</a>, other members have allegedly also ditched practice to play Pokémon Go, and to be quite honest, I can’t say I haven’t done the same (shh).</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Atashinchi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Atashinchi-copy.jpg><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>It isn’t every day that we see J-Hope talking about anime or manga, but once in a full moon, the rapper does admit to having watched at least some anime. When asked what his favorite childhood anime was, the dancer said it was Atashinchi. While this particular manga and anime didn’t become widely known here in the West, it was a huge success in Japan and Korea, and it seemed to have made an impression on the designated anime hater of the group.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Crayon Shin-Chan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Crayon-Shin-chan.jpg><p data-characters=517 data-current-count=817 data-injectable=true>Surprisingly, Atashinchi and Naruto weren’t the only anime that J-Hope openly claimed to enjoy. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naver</a>, all the members talked about some of their favorite anime, with J-Hope’s choice being Crayon Shin Chan. Let’s be honest, we’ve all watched Crayon Shin Chan, and it truly is a masterpiece. This light-hearted kid’s anime matched Hoseok’s personality like a glove if we’re being real here. Somehow, Shin Chan and Atashinchi also have the same energy.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bleach</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/bleach-ichigo-kurosaki.jpg><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=737 data-injectable=true>In an old interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Naver</a>, Jin talked about some of his favorite anime, where he immediately claimed Princess Mononoke as his favorite anime movie. However, in that same interview, Jin admits that his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former favorite anime and manga was Bleach</a>. The singer didn’t expand on his connection to Bleach, but he did admit that it was eventually dethroned by Dragon Ball and One Piece, but hey, we’re not mad about that at all.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Phantom Thief Jeanne</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Phantom-Thief-Jeanne.jpg><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=false>The biggest Shojo anime fan in the group, however, is seemingly V. The singer has the widest range in anime out of all the members, and apparently, as a kid, both his favorite manga were Shojo stories — Namely, Phantom Thief Jeanne and Full Moon o Sagashite. According to the singer, those types of stories and manga were all he read as a child, and I can just tell that Taehyung would have loved to watch Mermaid Melody with Namjoon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Szs7vMZqannV2ltqavxGarqGWjoa6uecOupaRlmJq%2FpnnAq5xmmqSoeqet1aipoqyVYq6vtcyeZJqmlGK6orrGmmY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-tall-is-kerri-medders-in-feet-everything-to-know-about-the-actress-from-promised-land.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Tall Is Kerri Medders In Feet?
