In 1990, she paid $185,000 for a house on Cambridge Street in Armadale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kylie-minogue-cambrigehouse.jpg><p>The street has 32 single-family homes, and her two-bedroom terrace looks a lot like 27 Cambridge Street, which sold for $2,175,000 in 2017.</p><p>She allegedly rents out her terrace, but if she ever decides to sell it, the recent sale of her next-door neighbor’s home implies she’ll earn a good profit.</p><h4>Monomyth Avenue</h4><p>Kylie bought her parents their current home on famed Monomeath Avenue across town, in the posh enclave of Canterbury.</p><p>She purchased the 2500 sqm property in 2002 for $2.43 million, including a pool and a luxury kitchen.</p><p>However, most of her assets are in London, where she resides in a $25 million penthouse in the opulent One Hyde Park building.</p><p>Other celebrities who have lived in the property, commonly regarded as the world’s most expensive apartment tower, including Naomi Campbell and Holly Valance.</p><h4>French Island</h4><p>The pop princess once owned a home on French Island in Westernport Bay, one of only two that can only be reached by helicopter or boat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kylie-minogue-frenchIsland-house.jpg.jpg><p>Kylie also admitted purchasing an opulent home in Los Angeles in 1999, which she only stayed in for a few nights before selling because she wasn’t spending as much time there as she had planned.</p><p>Her rumored home in Tossa De Mar, Spain, which she purchased for $839,000 to be closer to her then-boyfriend, Andre Velencoso Segura, was also mentioned.</p><h3>Cars</h3><p>Kylie Minogue, an Australian award-winning pop singer, was photographed arriving at rehearsals in a London dance studio in an ultra-plush black Maserati Gran Turismo S, adding to the gang of Maserati fans.</p><p>She arrived dressed appropriately in a leather jacket and heavy motorcycle boots, even though no one would have guessed she was a petrolhead.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Kylie has made the news in the automotive world.

She’s ruled the worlds of acting, music, fashion, and pop culture for almost three decades. With the publication of her second collection for Specsavers, she’s now added a designer to her portfolio.</p><h4>Work Out</h4><p>She said she didn’t have a strict fitness program in an interview with the Daily Express in 2017. Kylie, on the other hand, maintains a very active lifestyle.</p><p>“I don’t actually work out,” she admitted, “but I’m always on the go.”</p><p>She goes to Pilates sessions now and again, according to the actress. The singer revealed that her approach to fitness had evolved. She used to be a lot more interested in exercise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kylie-Minogue-Workout.jpg><p>“I used to do callanetics and enjoyed aerobics,” she recalled. “I would take my home workout on a VHS tape with me and play it in hotel rooms.”</p><p>Kylie also stated that she did not follow a rigorous diet plan but instead chose to eat healthful foods.</p><h4>Brands</h4><p>Chopard jewelry is a favorite of Kylie Minogue’s. A fancy-shaped diamond necklace set in white gold was the one she was seen wearing. The Australian singer looked gorgeous in it, and her tiny neck seemed to complement the piece.</p><p>Chopard is a Geneva-based jewelry firm that was first recognized for its pocket watches, in case you didn’t know. However, they have broadened their appeal, and Chopard jewelry is frequently the first pick of many celebrities, such as Kylie Jenner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jewellery-kylie-minogue-chopard-1024x1024.jpg><p>The production facility is located in Fleurier, and they have consistently maintained a high level of quality, earning them the Geneva Seal manufacturing standard.</p><p>The Dolce & Gabbana Lace-Print Stretch Silk dress was seen on the Australian vocalist. It has a broad neck and a V-shaped back opening. Kylie looked stunning in this dress, which had a back zip closure.</p><p>The outfit is from Dolce & Gabbana, a high-end design house. For their unusual designs, D&G dresses are particularly famous among Hollywood celebrities.</p><p>Leading celebrities such as Kylie Minogue, Isabella Rossellini, and Ayumi Hamasaki have worn D&G clothing.</p><h4>Jimmy Choo Parker Calfskin Shopper</h4><p>Jimmy Choo Parker Calfskin Shopper is a favorite of the singers. The bag has a buttery soft texture with secret magnetic two-way zip enclosures at the top. There is a zip pocket on the outside, and there is also a zip pocket on the inside.</p><p>The bag is handcrafted in Italy, and the exquisite suede inside is the bag’s key selling point. The bag was created by Jimmy Choo, a fashion designer headquartered in London. He focuses on women’s footwear and purses.</p><h4>Giuseppe Zanotti Suede Sandals</h4><p>Kylie adores her Giuseppe Zanotti suede sandals with crystal embellishments. The 4.5-inch heel on these shoes is quite substantial. The sandals have an almond toe and a broad front strap.</p><p>Another buckle-fastening strap runs around the ankle. These shoes were developed by Giuseppe Zanotti, who has been dubbed a “shoe obsessive” by many.</p><p>In 1993, he launched his own shoe brand, and his clientele quickly grew to include celebrities such as Kylie Minogue and Beyonce Knowles.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>Kylie Minogue took a trip to Portofino, Italy, for a vacation. She had a great time there, and there were images of Kylie sailing.</p><p>She traveled to Portofino, a little fishing community on the coast of the Ligurian Sea. The area is also well-known as a fantastic yachting destination.</p><p>Portofino has several fine hotels, all of which are within walking distance of the waterfront.
