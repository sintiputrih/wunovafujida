As a result, he relocated to Indiana and attended Clay High School. He graduated from high school in 1981 and returned to Ohio to attend Muskingum College.

He was later hired as an assistant coach for the Oakland Raiders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Jon-Grude-1.jpg><h2>Career</h2><p>Gruden began his coaching career as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Tennessee shortly after graduating. Gruden spent a year in Tennessee before taking over as quarterbacks coach at Southeast Missouri State for two years. Later, he was hired by Walt Harris, one of Tennessee’s offensive coordinators. At the University of the Pacific, he hired Gruden. He later worked for the San Francisco 49ers. Gruden joined the University of Pittsburgh in March 1991 as the wide receivers coach under head coach Paul Hackett.</p><p>Gruden’s first professional coaching job came in 1992, after a few years as a college coach, when he was hired as the Green Bay Packers’ special offensive assistant coach. He was with the Packers for three years before moving on to the Philadelphia Eagles as offensive coordinator.</p><p>Oakland Raiders Al Davis, the Oakland Raiders’ owner and general manager, hired Gruden as head coach for the 1998 season. Under Gruden, the Oakland Raiders improved to 8-8 after two consecutive losing seasons. The record was repeated the following season as well. However, when Gruden brought in veteran quarterback Rich Gannon in 2000, the team improved from 8-8 to 12-4, winning the AFC West. Furthermore, from 2000 to 2002, they made the playoffs three years in a row.</p><p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers After four seasons with the Raiders, Gruden took over as head coach of the Buccaneers, succeeding Tony Dungy. To get Gruden as coach, the Buccaneers had to make a massive trade. They eventually gave up two first-round picks, two second-round picks, and a large sum of money. But it was all worth it in the end. The Buccaneers’ offense improved in a year under Gruden. Furthermore, the team cruised to the Super Bowl for the first time in franchise history. They faced Gruden’s former team, the Raiders. Gruden’s familiarity with Gannon and the Raiders aided him in devising the ideal game plan. The Buccaneers won 48-21 and received a Super Bowl ring as a result. As a result, at the age of 39, Gruden became the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl.</p><p>The Super Bowl, on the other hand, came at a high price. The team was unable to replace the players who had been decimated by injuries. The Buccaneers missed the playoffs in 2003 with a 7-9 record before falling to 5-11 the following year. The team also had a bad year in 2004. Former Raiders general manager Bruce Allen joined the Buccaneers in 2004. By 2004-2005, the Buccaneers were back on track. Furthermore, 2005 marked the team’s return to the playoffs. Gruden, on the other hand, had his worst season as a head coach in 2006, going 4–12.</p><p>Gruden’s tenure with the Buccaneers was fraught with highs and lows. However, as they were regaining their footing in 2009, the Buccaneers lost four games in a row for the second time. As a result, on January 16, 2009, Gruden was fired.</p><p>After his contract with the Buccaneers expired, Gruden worked as a color analyst on ESPN’s Monday Night Football telecasts.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipnp2jmnqtsdGosGg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./kate-middleton-prince-william-pakistan-royal-visit-2019.html>&#171;&nbsp;Kate Middleton &amp;amp; Prince William Will Travel to Pakistan in 2019</a>
