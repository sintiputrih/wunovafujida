Stars like <a href=#>Chad Michael Murray</a> and <a href=#>Sophia Bush</a> left a lasting impression on the series, and they made sure to deliver the goods each episode. James Lafferty was a series mainstay, and since his time on the show, he has remained quite busy with other projects.</p><p>Let's take a look at what James Lafferty has been up to since One Tree Hill.</p><h2 id=39-one-tree-hill-39-put-james-lafferty-on-the-map>'One Tree Hill' Put James Lafferty On The Map</h2><p>After spending several years in Hollywood gaining some fantastic experience, everything changed for James Lafferty when he was cast as Nathan Scott on One Tree Hill. The series, which made its debut back in 2003, was an instant success for the network, and in no time at all, it became a small screen mainstay.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring talented performers like James Lafferty, Chad Michael Murray, Sophia Bush, and Hilarie Burton, One Tree Hill was the perfect blend of drama and intrigue, with plenty of hilarious moments sprinkled throughout. It never shied away from touching on heavier themes, and the exceptionally talented cast did a wonderful job in bringing the show to life each week.</p><p>The show was an amazing launching point for Lafferty, who starred on it from 2003 to 2012. However, things weren't so easy when the show first came to an end.</p><p>"I thought that when that show ended, things would be pretty easy for me, that it would be easy to work again in television. Coming out of One Tree Hill, I think it was a real reality check. It was a real wake-up call as to how incredibly competitive it is out there. I probably should have been doing a lot more work earlier in my career while I was doing One Tree Hill [in Wilmington, North Carolina] to build a foundation for myself back in Los Angeles," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said Lafferty</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite some struggles, the actor has found plenty of work over the years, including some projects in the world of film.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'One Tree Hill' Stars Reunite For Hulu Comedy Series 'Everyone Is Doing Great'</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-done-movies-like-39-small-town-crime-39>He's Done Movies Like 'Small Town Crime'</h2><p>While not a major film star at this stage of his career, James Lafferty has still taken opportunities to appear in some film projects. These projects are few and far between, sure, but they have still given him some valuable experience.</p><p>While he was still on One Tree Hill, the actor did appear in S. Darko, and since then, he has done a few other projects. These projects include Oculus, Waffle Street, and Small Town Crime. Nothing too major up until now, but this doesn't mean that Lafferty won't chase larger film projects at some point down the line.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As nice as it has been to watch James Lafferty thrive in the world of film, the truth is that most of his acting focus remains on the small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Things The Cast Of 'One Tree Hill' Recently Revealed About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=he-39-s-been-on-shows-like-39-the-haunting-of-hill-house-39>He's Been On Shows Like 'The Haunting Of Hill House'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/053AAF09-21C0-4FA3-9D0C-E0C734DDCE8F.jpeg><p>It should come as no surprise to fans that James Lafferty has done some awesome television work since his time on One Tree Hill.
