Teaming alongside Cody Rhodes, Seth Rollins, Sami Zayn, and Jey Uso, he played a pivotal role in defeating The Judgment Day and Drew McIntyre. It had been a return a year and a half in the making. Fans were elated when they got to see “The Viper” step back into the squared circle. Orton is a highly accomplished competitor and has put on classic matches. In addition, he has some of the most recognizable tattoos in WWE history. Let’s take a closer look at Orton’s famous pieces.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to throw a rock in a wrestling locker room and not hit someone <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">boasting a lot of tattoos</a>. Just like pro athletes, wrestlers enjoy getting themselves inked up and showing it off. Samoan wrestlers, in particular, have a fondness for ink with intricate tribal patterns. Other wrestlers can be highlighted, like Jeff Hardy and Rey Mysterio's amazingly tattooed bodies.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/collage-maker-12-mar-2023-02-29-pm-3142.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Meanings Behind WWE Legend Dave Bautista's Tattoos</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Batista's range of tattoos now covers a significant part of his body, having acquired multiple new tattoos during his wrestling career.</span><p>Another major tattooed wrestler is <a href=#><strong>Randy Orton</strong></a>. Since his WWE debut in 2002, Orton has shown a fondness for some ink with patterns on his back and arms. It's grown over the years with his arms almost totally covered and a few other tattoos elsewhere. While some have personal meaning, a few are interesting in the stories behind them, including a surprising controversy.

Orton is now happy he didn't get it as he prefers his more original tattoos over mimicking Goldberg's.

So you know, the tattoo artist said ‘How about, let’s come up with something that’s just for you,’ So okay, that’s a good idea. And so you know, some version, one of this was born.

Orton just got it for fun while he was <a href=#>starting his career in OVW</a>.</p><p>However, Orton didn't realize that having a back tattoo and then wrestling right after it was a bad idea.
